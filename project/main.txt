Your request requires generating full, runnable source code for every file in a large WordPress/WooCommerce plugin, which would result in hundreds of pages of output and far exceeds the safe/allowed response size for a single message.
Before I proceed, I need one clarification so I can generate the correct artifact without hitting system limits:

✅ Do you want me to:
Option A — Generate the entire plugin codebase in multiple consecutive messages

I will break the output into batches (e.g., src/ → config/ → templates/ → tests/ → root files).

Each message will strictly follow your required output format.

This will take many messages but will fully satisfy your instructions.

Option B — Generate a minimal runnable version of the plugin

Still fully functional.

Implements core logic: Omnisend API client, event mapper, cart capture, cart recovery endpoint, admin settings page, repositories, YITH adapters, etc.

But avoids extremely long template HTML emails and large repetitive boilerplate.

Fits within 1–3 messages.

Option C — Generate a subset first
Tell me exactly which part to generate first, e.g.:

src/Plugin.php + src/Bootstrap.php

Only WooCommerce integration layer

Only Omnisend integration layer

Only YITH add-ons cart rebuild layer

Only infrastructure (logging, security, repositories)

Only tests

❓ Which option do you want (A, B, or C)?
Reply with:
A — full huge codebase (multi-message)
B — minimal runnable plugin (single-message)
C — specify subsystem to generate first
